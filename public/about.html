<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>I am ayham alahmad and currenty studying to be a fullstack developer at udemy</h2>

<p>I always wanted to be a programmer but i didn't know what to choose
  so i just started learning with python then after a while
  my motivation to be a programmer changed to become game developer
  since i love games so i started with turtle module,
  there i spent quit a small time, then i started getting bored with it
  so i saw that there is something much better for learning game developing
  which is pygame i spent around 2 months using pygame
  but then yet again my motivation started to decrease and this time it was for an important reason
  which is lack of assets to become a game dev, u need  sounds and images to animate
  i lacked at this part and i really have no idea how to make these things
  i left programming by just saying oh my head is hurting me let me take a rest for an hour
  then by saying why couldn't i just take a break for a day
  i can play games for fun and motviate my self lol,
  in the end i started to take two and three days withot coding anything.
</p>

<p>i used to play  a single match in valorant every to or three day
  but after all what i faced in pygame  and me not wanting to do anything with it
i just started playing it every day first it was for  two or three matches
then half of the day and then that became my routing
waking up going to language school which is something is needed for immgrants in sweden
and after i come from school  i start playing valorant all the day
honstly i had no problem with the school i mean have english language
which made swedish and easy language for me
so every day i go to school everything  they teach there i was above it
so i started to getting bored with all of that
and started to just read novels in the school
and telling my self why not ? there is no thing to learn 
with that mindeset in the school and my minde set in my house my life just became no thing
and i am 23 years old i am at my besy youth days
so wasting it will make me suffer later espically after wasting my life from 11 to 20
over no thing just playing game and watching shows online
so i know what will happen to me if i started doing this again
and that's why i said to my self i have to stop This
but how ? i literally have no thing to do else
oneday while watching tiktok i saw a video about different programming jobs
one of them was front-end developer and it shocked me honstly
i mean front-end and web developers can earn more and that's not watch attracted me 
but the thing is, that web dev unlike game dev is slightly easier and not becaue it's simple or something
nah just becaue there are alot of resources you can use online and you don't need to depend on others
so that attracted me becaues this is what i always wanted
so the idea of becoming web dev ignited in my minde
and for my luck  later on that day i was surfing facebook
and i saw a post in a programming group
that post was talking about how  he has this paid course for free etc
so i went dirctly to udemy which is something i didnt know yet and saw there is the course
and the course cost 80 euro but with discount cost only 15
and the instructor was so popular on the site with good rating so that encourged me more do buy it
but still hesistated and when i retunred hom i bought it i was tired i wanted to sleep so i didnt start studying it
from the first day but in the second day i did
and from that my journy begins , i am still in the day 3 and i will be updating the current day every day <br>
